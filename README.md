Am I Up To Date is a simple mod designed to be included in modpacks to check the local version against the most recent version and notify the user of an update. For the time being the mod versions and links are hard-coded meaning its not very end user friendly, this is being worked on.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Currently Supported:
Minecraft 1.21.1 on Fabric 0.16.7, Modrinth modpacks

Planned:

High Priority:
* Read modpack versions from config file
* Curseforge suport

Medium Priority:
* Backport to 1.20.x (and beyond)

At this time I have no plans to port to Forge/NeoForge as they arent platforms I'm interested in. Feel free to make your own port (or submit a pull request) and let me know so I can link people to it
