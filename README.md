Am I Up To Date is a simple mod designed to be included in modpacks to check the local version against the most recent version and notify the user of an update. For the time being the mod versions and links are hard-coded meaning its not very end user friendly, this is being worked on (just need to read values from the config, will do when I wake up).

At this time I have no plans to port to Forge/NeoForge as they arent platforms I'm interested in. Feel free to make your own port (or submit a pull request) and let me know so I can link people to it
